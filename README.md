# Ex-Order2
Another C# Ordering System Template

Make a program to read N data products (not supplied by the user). At end, show the price tag of each product on the same order as they
were typed. Every product has name and price. Products imported have a customs duty, and Used products have date of manufacture.
These specific data should be added to the price tag. For products imported, the tax and customs should be added to the final price of the
product.
